title: Focal Length, Aperture and Crop Factor APSC vs. Full Frame
---

Understanding the effect of crop factor on angle of view, distortion, and noise is complicated.
This difficulty often causes a whole host of misunderstandings.

Crop Factor
===========
The crop factor indicates the size of the image sensor or film frame. Crop factor is the ratio of the diagonal of the frame to the diagonal of a standard 35mm frame.

```
(Crop Factor) = (frame diagonal) / sqrt(36^2 +  24^2)
```

Common Crop Factors:

Canon APS-C
: 1.6
General APS-C 
: 1.5
35mm full frame
: 1.0
Medium Format 645
: 0.62
Medium Format 6x6
: 0.55
Medium Format 6x7
: 0.5
