I created this image in 3D with [Blender3d](http://www.blender.org/), which is an awesome, free, open source, 3d modeling, animation and compositing program.

Materials
=========
Here I'm using the material demo scene from [blendermada](http://blendermada.com/uploads/stuff/) to showcase the materials.

All of the materials use procedural textures.

**Striped Ball Material:**
The stripes on the material were created with a procedural brick texture driven from the normal coordinates.

**Scratched Paint Material:**
Same as the above material but without the stripes, this material is used for the handle.

**Bright Bare Metal Material:**
This material is also used for part of the handle and with a darker base color.

**Tile Slate Material:**
I spent the least ammount of time on this material since it's not as prominent.
