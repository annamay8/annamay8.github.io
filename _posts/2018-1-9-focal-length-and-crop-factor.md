title: 35mm Equivalent Focal Length, Aperture and it's Effect on Depth of Field, Distortion, etc.
---

Understanding the effect of crop factor on angle of view, distortion, and noise is complicated.
This difficulty often causes a whole host of misunderstandings.

Crop Factor
===========
The crop factor indicates the size of the image sensor or film frame. Crop factor is the ratio of the diagonal of the frame to the diagonal of a standard 35mm frame.

```
(Crop Factor) = (frame diagonal) / sqrt(36^2 +  24^2)
```

Common Crop Factors:

Canon APS-C
:   1.6

General APS-C 
:   1.5

35mm full frame
:   1.0

Medium Format 645
:   0.62

Medium Format 6x6
:   0.55

Medium Format 6x7
:   0.5

35mm Equivalent Focal Length (FoV)
==================================
Two pictures with the same 35mm equivalent focal length will have the same field of view. Field of view can also be expressed in terms of degrees but a 35mm-equivalent focal length measure in mm is usually used as it's more familiar to photographers.

To obtain the 35mm-equivalent focal length, multiply the focal length by the crop factor. Smaller sensor sizes result in longer 35mm-equivalent focal lengths and vice versa.

35mm Equivalent Aperture
========================
Aperture determines the diameter of the light opening in the lens. The aperature is the ratio of the diameter of the lens opening to the focal length.

The effect of a given aperture changes with the sensor size the same way focal length does. The 35mm equivalent aperture is obtained by multiplying the aperture by the crop factor. Smaller sensor sizes result in a smaller (larger f-number) 35mm equivalent aperture.

Varying the aperture has two effects. A larger aperture (smaller f-number) results in shallower depth of field and lets in more light.

A photo taken with the same 35mm equivalent aperature and the same 35mm equivalent focal length will exibit the same depth of field.

35mm Equivalent ISO
=================== 
The ammount of noise can vary significantly among sensors and film stocks so the notion of a 35mm-equivalent ISO is less usefull than the other 35mm-equivalent measures.

Though it is not commonly talked about, it is possible to use the concept of a 35mm-equivalent ISO. You can arrive at a 35mm-equivalent ISO, by multiplying the ISO by the crop factor. 35mm equivalent ISO determines the ammount of noise in the picture.

Distortion and Subject Distance
===============================
Distortion of a subject is only dependent on distance from the subject. Larger subject distance is commonly said to be more flattering to subjects because it distorts features less.

Equivalent Final Photo Results
==============================
A photo taken with the same 35mm equivalent focal length, 35mm equivalent aperture, 35mm equivalent ISO, and subject distance will be identical regardless of sensor size. The ammount of detail in the photo may depend on the sensor megapixels and lense quality but the overall appearance of the image will be the same. If only the 35mm equivalent ISO is different, but the other parameters are the same, then the picture will still be exactly the same except for a different overall ammount of noise.
